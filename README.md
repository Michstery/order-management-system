# Order Management System

A backend service built with NestJS and MongoDB to manage users, products, and orders. This project demonstrates best practices in API design, dependency injection, and microservices architecture, with Swagger documentation and comprehensive testing.

## Overview

The Order Management System provides RESTful APIs for:
- Managing users (customers)
- Managing products
- Managing orders

Key features:
- Modular architecture with NestJS
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- Swagger API documentation
- Unit and integration tests with Jest
- Environment variable configuration

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: v16.x or later (recommended)
- **npm**: v8.x or later (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB**: Local installation or a MongoDB URI (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd order-management-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following configuration:
```
# .env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/order-management
```
- `PORT`: The port on which the application will run (default: 3000)
- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string (replace with your own if using a remote database)

### 4. Start MongoDB
If you're using a local MongoDB instance, ensure it's running:
```bash
mongod
```
Alternatively, use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas and update the `MONGODB_URI` accordingly.

### 5. Run the Application
Start the NestJS application in development mode:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Access Swagger Documentation
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/api
```
This displays the Swagger UI with interactive API documentation for all endpoints.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run start`: Run the app in production mode
- `npm run start:dev`: Run the app in development mode with hot-reloading
- `npm run build`: Build the TypeScript code into JavaScript
- `npm run test`: Run all unit and integration tests
- `npm run test:cov`: Run tests with coverage report
- `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode

## API Endpoints

### Users
- `POST /users`: Create a new user
- `GET /users/:id`: Get user details by ID
- `GET /users/:id/orders`: Get all orders for a user

### Products
- `POST /products`: Create a new product
- `GET /products/:id`: Get product details by ID
- `GET /products`: Get all products

### Orders
- `POST /orders`: Create a new order
- `GET /orders/:id`: Get order details by ID
- `GET /orders`: Get all orders

For detailed request/response schemas, refer to the Swagger documentation at `/api`.

## Testing

The project includes unit and integration tests using Jest and an in-memory MongoDB server.

### Prerequisites for Testing
Install additional dev dependencies if not already present:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @nestjs/testing jest @types/jest ts-jest mongodb-memory-server @shelf/jest-mongodb supertest
```

### Running Tests
Run all tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

Generate a coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:cov
```

<!-- ## Bonus Features (Optional)

To implement bonus features:
- **JWT Authentication**: Install `@nestjs/jwt` and `@nestjs/passport`
- **Caching**: Use `@nestjs/cache-manager`
- **Docker**: Add `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- **Rate Limiting**: Use `@nestjs/throttler`

Refer to the NestJS documentation for implementation details. -->

## Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB Connection Error**: Ensure MongoDB is running and the `MONGODB_URI` is correct.
- **Port Conflict**: Change the `PORT` in `.env` if 3000 is in use.
- **Test Failures**: Verify MongoDB in-memory server setup and dependencies.
